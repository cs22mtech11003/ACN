# Socket Programming

## 1. Part A

a. Create a server (file server) program. It listens on a TCP socket. The
server is meant to send specific file(s) (.txt/.png/.pdf) to its client
depending on the file requested (file path).

b. Create a client program which interacts with the file server on TCP. Client
TCP connects to the file server to fetch a file given the file path in the
server. Assume that a valid client knows the ip address, port number of
the file server.

## 2. Part B

a. Extend the file server program in Part A to serve multiple clients in
parallel. i.e. if two different clients ask for a file, the server shall satisfy
both the clients in parallel without making any client wait. Maximum
number of clients to honor can be set at the server.

b. Create one server program as per #a above and many instances of valid
clients mentioned in Part A and check the working of parallel file download
from the server. Check for all possible errors for which the server may give
error message/error code to the client. E.g., file doesnâ€™t exist. Check the
situation when the server is busy serving other clients and one client has
to wait for the server to start serving it after serving other clients.
